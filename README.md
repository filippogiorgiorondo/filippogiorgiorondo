# 👋 Hi there, I'm Filippo!

Python Developer 💻 | Machine Learning Engineer 🤖 | Cloud ☁️ | Cybersecurity Analyst 🔐 

I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn, experiment and build cool things 🚀
I started coding out of curiosity during high school, and since then I've been hooked — especially by the idea of solving real-world problems through code and smart systems.

### 🧠 Skills & Technologies
- 🟢 As a Python Developer for Machine Learning and Data Analysis, I focus on object-oriented programming, file and error handling, and efficient data manipulation. I work daily with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mysql-connector, and Requests — often leveraging REST APIs and JSON responses to integrate external data sources into analytical workflows.
I'm also experienced in managing relational databases, particularly MySQL, where I use SQL to write and optimize complex queries for CRUD operations.
In the field of machine learning, I use scikit-learn to build and evaluate predictive models, applying standard techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering — from data preprocessing to model validation.

- 🔵 On the cybersecurity side, I’ve gained hands-on experience in both offensive and defensive security. I’m familiar with penetration testing techniques and the MITRE ATT&CK framework for threat modeling and attack simulation. I’ve worked on malware prevention, vulnerability assessment, and system hardening, combining a solid understanding of networking and automation through scripting. My tools include Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nessus, and Security Onion, which I’ve used extensively in real-world lab environments and personal projects.
